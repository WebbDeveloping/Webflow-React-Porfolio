      "ProjectOverview": "My brother has been working with leather for years, and I've always been interested in it as well. Recently, we decided to start a side project together: a website selling digital leather templates. These templates can be used by other leather workers to get perfect cuts on their projects. We're really excited about this project, and we think it has a lot of potential. We're already seeing some great feedback from our customers, and we're looking forward to growing this business in the future.",
      "ProjectContribution": "I built the websites, the sales funnels, the checkout and email sequence. My brother only participated in providing the digital templates we sell. The website project was a side project that we agreed to do together. He would provide the Digital Leather Template and I would build the website. Once the website was built, I added the sales funnel and checkout process. I also created the email sequence that potential customers receive after they purchase our product. In other words, everything that is \"digital\" is done by myself. I have a deep understanding of GoHighLevel works and what is needed to create a successful online business.",
      "clientfeedback": "Joe did an incredible job bringing the website he envisioned to life. I'm extremely grateful for all his hard work and dedication in making this project a success. Joe's dedication and attention to detail resulted in a website that perfectly reflects our company's image and values. I couldn't be happier with the final product, and I know that our customers will be impressed as well. Thanks, Joe, for everything!",
      "finalthought": "I am really happy I was able to piece together this side project through GoHighLevel. It was fairly easy and had great results. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the platform and would recommend it to anyone looking to start a side project. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy your time on my website!",

Not only was it outdated and difficult to navigate, but it was also not optimised for lead generation. I copied their site to a newer platform and made a number of changes to the design and layout. In addition, I implemented a digital marketing campaign that utilised Google and Facebook ads. As a result, the client saw a significant increase in leads and sales.",

My team was tasked with building out all the automation to help convert website visitors into leads for this site.

I started by streamlining the navigation and making it easier for visitors to find the information they were looking for. I also added some engaging visuals and simplified the overall design. As a result of these changes, the studio has seen a significant increase in both web traffic and new students.",
